## My process

First time completing a Front End Mentor exercise, wanted to see
what it was about. The exercise was straightforward, I started with creating
semantic html with BEM style class names. I then proceeded with implementing the base colors and styles for the overall project. Then styled the items block by block from the top - down. I had to do a lot of tinkering and use precise values to have the spacing, padding, etc. between elements to look exact, but I was able to get as close as I could.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This exercise has given me valuable practice with markdown documents, which I know will play a big role in the future when I have to write documentation. Besides practice in markdown, I haven't learned anything new, but I was able to get some valuable practice in HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing my skills in mimicking design files. I believe Front End Mentor is the perfect tool for practicing those skills. It will help me highlight any weaknesses and strengths I have and improve upon them.
